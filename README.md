## Academic Python Project â€“ L1 MIASHS

This project was developed during the first year of the MIASHS program (option Health)

It focuses on basic data processing in Python: 
reading and filtering CSV files,
computing descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.), 
and measuring execution time.
The code is modular and tested.

### Structure
- `DONNEES/`: CSV data files  
- `outils_*.py`: utility functions  
- `SF_*.py`: main functions and tests
